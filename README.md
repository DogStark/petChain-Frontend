## 👀 Overview
PetChain is a decentralized platform on StarkNet that securely manages pet medical records.
Today, health data is often scattered, lost, or stuck in outdated systems—making it hard to track vaccinations, manage treatments, or respond quickly in emergencies.

By making records tamper-proof and universally accessible, PetChain keeps vets and pet owners aligned—no matter where the pet is or who’s treating them.
Pets get a scannable tag for quick access to key medical details. This tag can act as a tracker if pet goes missing.

## ⚡ Features
**1. Scannable Pet Tags:** Each pet gets a unique QR code and tag linked to its medical history—instantly scannable by vets or emergency responders. The tag displays key info and a customizable message from the owner, doubling as a tracker if the pet goes missing.

**2. Always-Available Records:** Medical history is stored on StarkNet, ensuring records are tamper-proof, permanent, and accessible anytime.

**3. Controlled Access:** Pet owners control who sees what, share vaccination status publicly or give full access to a vet when needed.

**4. Smart Notifications:** Get automatic alerts for upcoming vaccinations and routine check-ups, so you never miss a date.

**5. Vet-Ready Integration:** Designed to plug into existing vet or hospital software with minimal friction.

**6. Offline Mode** – View essential info even without internet.

**7. Privacy:** Uses advanced cryptography (like ZKPs) to keep sensitive data secure, even on-chain.
